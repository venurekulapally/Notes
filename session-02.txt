Recap
what is devops?
waterfall vs agile vs devops
SDLC
what is computer
client server architecture
Linux advantages

Create Linux Server
Connect to it
Create firewall/Security group
Command syntax
few commands

Authentication
---------------
1. What you know -> Username and password --> private systems
2. What you have --> username and tokens(RSA, Authenticator) --> Public systems
3. What you are --> Fingerprints, palm, retina, face, etc --> Public systems

lock and key are pair

box and lock are public
key is private

key based mechanism
key pair == public key and private key

box = server == node == Ip address
public key is inside server

while authenticating user should send his username and private-key

Delhi --> Hyderbad(DTDC)
--------------------
flat no, apartment name, street name, city, pincode

Pincode(HYD DTDC)
Streetname
apartment name
if no flat no, letter is stuck apartment name

Server --> it has lot of services, every service has protocol

I can open google in browser using HTTP-80/HTTPS-443

SSH protocol is used to connect to servers with particular number. port no 22

0-65,535 ports == 65,536 ports

ssh --> 22
http --> 80
https  --> 443
mysql --> 3306

what is the protocol, port, username, password/private-key

ssh-keygen -f <file-name>, I should have some client to connect Linux server
gitbash, putty, mobaxterm

Gitbash --> git, Linux server, Mini Linux in windows

/c/Users/ramesh

present working directory == pwd

.xls
.doc

ssh-rsa <random-code> laptop-username@laptop-name

internet --> 0.0.0.0/0 --> public

1. import public key
2. create firewall

OS, CPU, RAM, HD

Amazon Linux 2023 == RedHat == CentOs

98.81.6.228
ec2-user
ssh
22
private-key

/home/<user-name> == Landing Directory
$ --> normal user

command-name <options> <inputs>

pwd
clear
cd --> change directory

cd /

/ --> root directory

ls -l --> l for lenghty format
ls -lr --> reverse order

ls -lt --> based on time, latest on top
ls -ltr --> latest on down

hidden files starts with .
ls -la --> a means all


CRUD --> Create Read Update Delete

sign up --> creating profile in amazon
Login --> reading my account
password change --> updating the profile
account delete --> deleting the account

placing order --> creating order
changing order details --> updating order
cancelling order --> deleting the order

CRUD

create, read, update and delete

touch --> create file

touch file-name --> creates the file
cat > devops.txt --> adding text
enter the text
ctrl+D

cat file-name --> reading the text


cat >> file-name --> append/add the text


cd .. --> one step back

rm --> remove file

mkdir --> create directory
mkdir devops

d--> directory
- --> file

rmdir --> remove only empty directory

rm -r --> delete folder and content inside folder

mv <old-file-name> <new-file-name>
command-name <options> <inputs>
mv awss.txt aws.txt

-<single-char> or --<word> == Options

absolute(complete) path and relative path

cd .. --> relative path
cd /home/ec2-user --> absolute


1. Create AWS account
2. Install gitbash and notepad++
3. create keypairs
4. Import public key into AWS
5. Create security group
6. launch instance
7. connect to instance from gitbash
